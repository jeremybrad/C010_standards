  debugging:

# ========================================
# IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES
# ========================================

implementation_notes:
  - "Consider register when tagging: same term may need different tags in Claude vs Betty contexts"
  - "Work emotions (breakthrough, clarity) are as valid as poetic emotions (sacred, velvet)"
  - "Business terms in creative contexts should be tagged as 'integrative'"
  - "High-value content often occurs at intersection of technical and creative"
  - "Respect both analytical precision and poetic expression as equal modes"

validation_rules:
  - "Any term appearing in both corpora needs disambiguation logic"
  - "Emotion assignments should reflect the register being used"
  - "Content type 'integrative' captures cross-register synthesis"
  - "Sacred emotions should not be demoted as 'less important' than work emotions"
