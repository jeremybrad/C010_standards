| W001_cmo-weekly-reporting | 0 | Compliant |
| W002_analytics | 0 | LOCAL ONLY (no GitHub) |

### Totals
- **C-series**: 16 repos, ~127 exception dirs declared, 14 pushed to GitHub
- **W-series**: 11 repos, ~28 exception dirs declared, 8 pushed to GitHub
- **Combined**: 27 repos processed, 22 pushed

### Artifacts Created Per Repo
- `00_admin/audit_exceptions.yaml` - Declares legacy dirs with justification and planned destination
- `.gitattributes` - CRLF normalization rules
- `rules_now.md` - (where missing) Operational rules stub
- `RELATIONS.yaml` - (where missing) Dependency declarations

### Local-Only Repos (No GitHub Remote)
| Repo | Notes |
|------|-------|
| C016_prompt-engine | Exception file committed locally, needs remote or archival decision |
| W002_analytics | Compliant (no exception file needed), needs remote or archival decision |
| W012_hardening_bundle | Exception file committed locally, needs remote or archival decision |

### Fixes Applied This Session
1. **W003_cmo_html_report**: Merged branch `w003/folder-remediation-v1` to main and pushed

### Next Steps
1. P-series repos (quick wins vs manual migration)
2. Add GitHub remotes to local-only repos OR mark for archival
3. Quarterly review of exception files (next: 2026-03-31)

### Protocol Reference
- Exception file format: `00_admin/audit_exceptions.yaml`
- .gitattributes template: Cross-platform CRLF handling
- Betty Protocol allowed dirs: `00_admin|00_run|10_docs|20_receipts|20_approvals|20_inbox|30_config|40_src|50_data|70_evidence|80_evidence_packages|90_archive`
