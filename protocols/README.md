# Governance Protocols

Canonical workspace governance documents consolidated from workspace-level sources. Each file retains upstream wording and attribution in the header.

## Canonical Files
- `betty_protocol.md` — Workspace edition of the Betty Protocol (v2025-09-07) sourced from `/Users/jeremybradford/SyncedProjects/WORKSPACE_BETTY_PROTOCOL.md`.
- `universal_claude_standards.md` — Shared runtime expectations for Claude assistants, extracted from `P001_bettymirror/CLAUDE.md` and `Infrastructure/CLAUDE.md` (v1.0, updated 2025-08-19).

## Maintenance Notes
- Update upstream sources first; then refresh the copies here, keeping version/date headers intact.
- When upstream standards diverge, document differences in `notes/CHANGELOG.md` and annotate the affected files.
- Additional governance doctrines (e.g., repo-specific overrides) should live alongside these files with clear provenance notes.
