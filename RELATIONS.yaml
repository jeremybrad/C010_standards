repo: C010_standards

owns:
  - "Workspace protocols and governance rules (Betty Protocol, README repo card standard)"
  - "Data schemas (DocMeta, CodeMeta, Houston configs)"
  - "Classification taxonomies (topics, emotions, metadata)"
  - "Validation tools (Houston validators, README repo card checker)"
  - "Project registry: registry/repos.yaml (source of truth) and 70_evidence/workspace/KNOWN_PROJECTS.md (derived output)"
  - "Bootstrap scripts for bulk repo upgrades (Ruff, testing, Claude support)"
  - "Agent onboarding documentation (AGENT_START_HERE.md)"

must_not_own:
  - "Runtime services or deployable applications (belongs to individual project repos)"
  - "Data storage, embeddings, or artifacts (belongs to $SADB_DATA_DIR and C003)"
  - "Memory infrastructure pipelines (belongs to C002/C003 SADB repos)"
  - "Project-specific configuration or code (stays in respective repos)"
  - "Health monitoring or service dashboards (belongs to C001_mission-control)"

depends_on:
  # C010 is the foundation - no upstream dependencies
  # Other repos depend on C010 for standards

relates_to:
  - repo: C019_docs-site
    reason: "C019 consumes C010 docs for publishing/search; C010 recognizes C019 as canonical publishing surface"
    note: "Not a runtime dependency - C010 functions without C019; this is the designated publishing layer"
