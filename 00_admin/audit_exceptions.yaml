reason: |
  C010_standards defines the Betty Protocol folder structure.
  Its content directories exist at top-level for:
  1. Discoverability - consumers expect schemas/taxonomies/protocols at obvious paths
  2. Import compatibility - validators/ is a Python package with 30+ internal imports
  3. Submodule stability - C001_mission-control references these paths via git submodule

# Per-directory justification (known weirdness > unknown weirdness)
# Minimal set per 2025-01-01 cleanup - reduced from 10 to 7 exceptions
allowed_additional_dirs:
  - schemas       # Core deliverable: YAML/JSON schema definitions for DocMeta, CodeMeta, Houston
  - taxonomies    # Core deliverable: controlled vocabularies (topics, emotions, content types)
  - protocols     # Core deliverable: Betty Protocol docs, META.yaml spec, cross-platform hooks
  - validators    # Python package: Houston validators with internal imports (check_houston_*.py)
  - tests         # Python tests: pytest suite for validators, requires validators/ at sibling level
  - registry      # Config registry: repos.yaml consumed by C017_brain-on-tap primers
  - scripts       # Operational scripts: audit_folder_structure.sh referenced from 00_run/

# Override default required files (rules_now.md and RELATIONS.yaml exist but are minimal)
required_files:
  - README.md

# Cleanup completed 2025-01-01:
# - prompts/: Deleted (was empty)
