# Constitution Sweep Closeout Receipt

**Date**: 2026-01-13
**Operation**: Close session with final polish and documentation fixes

## Summary

Finalized constitution sweep work for C010_standards. All drift guardrails are now enforced via `validators/check_constitution.py`.

## Changes This Session

### Constitution Validator Added
- Created `validators/check_constitution.py` with 6 drift checks (all FAIL severity)
- Wired into `run_all.py` - runs by default
- All 7 validators now pass

### Documentation Fixes
- Fixed KNOWN_PROJECTS.md paths across 4 files (must use `70_evidence/workspace/` prefix)
- Fixed `cd validators` instructions → "run from repo root"
- Fixed META.yaml folder naming (`00-Governance` → `00_admin`)

### RELATIONS.yaml Upgrade
- v1 → v2 with owns/must_not_own/depends_on structure
- Defines C010 boundaries for automation and LLMs

### Primer Owner Fix
- Owner now shows "Jeremy Bradford" (generator mapping fixed in C021)

## Constitution Truths (Machine-Enforced)

| Rule | Enforcement |
|------|-------------|
| Repo ID = C010_standards | FAIL if C000_info-center outside 70_evidence/ |
| Exit codes = 0/1/2 only | FAIL if 99 mentioned or 2 missing |
| Run from repo root | FAIL if `cd validators` recommended |
| Python 3.11+ | FAIL if lower version stated |
| KNOWN_PROJECTS path | FAIL if missing 70_evidence/ prefix |

## Files Changed (This Commit)

- `PROJECT_PRIMER.md` - Regenerated, owner now correct
- `RELATIONS.yaml` - Upgraded to v2 boundaries format

## Not Committed (Separate Work)

- `20_receipts/2026-01-12_project_primer_rollout.md`
- `protocols/project_primer_protocol.md`

## Next Steps

- Upload latest primer (sha256:724bb5e6b8aa) to C010 Projects
- No open issues for constitution enforcement
