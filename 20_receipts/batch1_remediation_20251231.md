# Batch 1 Remediation Receipt
## Date: 2025-12-31

### Summary

Completed Batch 1 of folder structure remediation - 3 quick-win repos.

### Repos Remediated

| Repo | Issue | Fix | SHA |
|------|-------|-----|-----|
| P010_betty-ai | Missing README.md | Created README.md | `7c30b42` |
| C005_mybuddy | Missing 00_run/ | Created 00_run/README.md | `b8a1b74` |
| C008_CBFS | Missing 00_run/ | Created 00_run/README.md | `46c45cc` |

### Additional Fix: C005 Pre-commit Hook

Updated `.git/hooks/pre-commit` in C005_mybuddy to include Betty Protocol dirs:
- Added: `00_run`, `50_data`, `80_evidence_packages`
- This was blocking the 00_run/ commit

### Verification

All repos:
- Committed with proper message format
- Pushed to origin/main
- Pre-commit hooks passed

### Next Steps

1. **Re-run audit** to verify reduction in violations
2. **Phase 3**: Merge P032_enhanced-whisper to main
3. **Batch 2 (next session)**: C011_agents, W009_context_library
