# Standards Rollout Receipt

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-26 16:10
**Session:** Autofix-safe pass + migration planning
**Status:** Phase 1 complete

## Executive Summary

Executed first enforcement pass of C010 folder structure standards across 61 SyncedProjects repos.

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Compliant repos | 19 | 43 | **+24** |
| Compliance rate | 31% | 70% | **+39pp** |
| Total violations | 175 | 130 | **-45** |

## What Was Done

### 1. Autofix-safe Pass
Created 44 stub files across 24 repos:
- `rules_now.md` - Points to C010 canonical Betty Protocol
- `RELATIONS.yaml` - Project relationship mapping stub
- `00_run/` - Easy button directory (for C/W series)

### 2. Commits Made
Successfully committed autofix stubs to:
- **C-series (7):** C004, C007, C015, C016, C017, C019, C020
- **P-series (12):** P001, P004, P010, P013, P090, P171, P172, P190, P211, P212, P214, P215
- **W-series (2):** W012, W166
- **U-series (1):** U01

### 3. Blocked by Pre-commit Hooks
These repos need their `.pre-commit-config.yaml` updated to allow `00_run/`:
- C006_revelator
- C009_mcp-memory-http (also: secret detection failure)
- C019_docs-site
- W166_fiber-vs-home_reconciliation

### 4. Migration Plan Created
Generated `folder_structure_migration_plan_latest.csv` with 90 directory mappings:
- 65 low risk
- 23 medium risk
- 2 high risk

Actions breakdown:
- 58 moves
- 19 renames
- 6 merges
- 7 manual reviews needed

## Remaining Work

### Still Non-Compliant (18 repos)

**7 C-series (need migration):**
- C001_mission-control (2 dirs)
- C002_sadb (3 dirs)
- C003_sadb_canonical (9 dirs)
- C005_mybuddy (2 dirs)
- C008_CBFS (7 dirs)
- C011_agents (7 dirs)
- C018_terminal-insights (3 dirs)

**2 P-series:**
- P010_betty-ai (needs README.md - not auto-created)
- P092_mirrorlab (1 dir - PILOT candidate)

**9 W-series (need migration):**
- W001_cmo-weekly-reporting (6 dirs)
- W002_analytics (3 dirs)
- W003_cmo_html_report (6 dirs)
- W005_BigQuery (5 dirs)
- W006_Abandoned_Cart (16 dirs - complex)
- W007_Snowflake_SQL_Library (8 dirs)
- W008_QQ (1 dir - PILOT candidate)
- W009_context_library (3 dirs)
- W011_peer-review (8 dirs)

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate: Run 2 Pilot Migrations

1. **W008_QQ** - 1 directory rename (50_receipts → 20_receipts)
2. **P092_mirrorlab** - 1 directory rename (60_data → 50_data)

### Short-term: Fix Pre-commit Hooks
Update repos blocking `00_run/` to include it in allowed dirs.

### Medium-term: Batch Migrations
Use migration plan CSV to execute migrations in tiers:
- Tier 1: 1-3 dirs, low risk (7 repos)
- Tier 2: 4-6 dirs, mixed risk (6 repos)
- Tier 3: 7+ dirs, complex (4 repos)

## Deliverables
