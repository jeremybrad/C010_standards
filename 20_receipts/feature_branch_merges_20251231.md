## Summary

Completed merging/promoting 5 P-series repos from `modernize/sprint2-mining` feature branches to their default branches.

## Repos Processed

| Repo | Action Taken | Final Default Branch |
|------|--------------|---------------------|
| P031_sillytavern | Pushed feature branch, updated GitHub default | `modernize/sprint2-mining` |
| P091_voice-notes-pipeline | Already done, cleaned up stale local master | `modernize/sprint2-mining` |
| P152_cognitiveplayback | Already done, no action needed | `modernize/sprint2-mining` |
| P158_local-tts | Already done, cleaned up stale local master | `modernize/sprint2-mining` |
| P159_memory-system | Updated GitHub default, deleted old default branch | `modernize/sprint2-mining` |

## Technical Notes

### P031_sillytavern
- Had unrelated histories issue preventing traditional merge
- Resolved by pushing feature branch and using `gh repo edit` to set new default
- Old default branch deleted from GitHub

### P091, P152, P158
- `origin/HEAD` already pointed to `modernize/sprint2-mining`
- Only cleanup of stale local `master` branches required

### P159_memory-system
- GitHub default was `claude/standardize-p159-betty-protocol-01HZPXeAsPazjbpLEryHyzbS`
- Updated to `modernize/sprint2-mining` via `gh repo edit`
- Old default branch deleted from GitHub and local master cleaned up

## Verification

All repos now have:
- `modernize/sprint2-mining` as GitHub default branch
- Folder audit exception files (`00_admin/audit_exceptions.yaml`)
- Cross-platform `.gitattributes`
