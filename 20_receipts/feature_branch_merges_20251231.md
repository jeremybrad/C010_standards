# Feature Branch Merges Receipt
## Date: 2025-12-31

## Summary

Completed merging/promoting 5 P-series repos from `modernize/sprint2-mining` feature branches. Default branches are now correctly set to `main`.

## Correction Notice

**Initial error**: Default branches were incorrectly set to `modernize/sprint2-mining` instead of `main`.

**Correction applied**: Created `main` from feature branch HEAD, set as GitHub default, deleted feature branch.

**Rule**: Default branch must be `main` across repos unless explicitly documented otherwise.

- Deleted `modernize/sprint2-mining` from remote and local
- Updated `origin/HEAD` to point to `main`
