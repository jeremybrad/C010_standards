# Receipt: C019_docs-site Integration into C010_standards

**Date**: 2026-01-13
**Session**: Claude Code integration of C019 as canonical docs publishing surface
**Status**: Complete

## Summary

Integrated C019_docs-site into C010_standards as the canonical documentation publishing and search surface. This establishes the formal relationship between:
- **C010_standards**: Canonical SOURCE of standards content (protocols, schemas, taxonomies)
- **C019_docs-site**: Canonical PUBLISHING + SEARCH surface (MkDocs + Docs RAG)

## Why

1. Make the C010 → C019 relationship discoverable in governance docs and registry
2. Allow future repos to understand where docs are published/searchable
3. Provide a standards-backed source of truth for C001 `/docs` integration
4. Prevent ad-hoc docs site sprawl across repos

## Changes Made

### 1. README.md
- Added C019 to "Related repos" table with description: "Canonical docs publishing/search surface (MkDocs + Docs RAG)"
- Added "Docs Publishing" row to "Interfaces and contracts" table with contract statement

### 2. docs/standards/OVERVIEW.md
- Added C019 to "Integration Points" table
- Added new "Docs Publishing Model" section documenting:
  - Authoring/Publishing/Search/UI Client layers
  - Update propagation workflow
  - Anti-patterns (do-not-do list)

### 3. META.yaml
- Added `C019_docs-site: "Publishes/searches workspace docs (MkDocs + Docs RAG)"` to `relates_to` section

### 4. RELATIONS.yaml
- Added `relates_to` section with C019 entry
- Documented relationship reason and clarified it's not a runtime dependency

### 5. protocols/docs_publishing.md (NEW)
- Created canonical "Workspace Documentation Publishing & Search" protocol
- Documents architecture diagram, ownership boundaries, update workflow
- Specifies ports (8123 RAG API, 8085 MkDocs)
- Lists anti-patterns and discovery guidance

### 6. registry/repos.yaml
- Enhanced C019_docs-site entry with:
  - Expanded purpose, philosophy, story, how_it_fits
  - Full architecture, interfaces, onboarding, entry_points
  - Key concepts, common tasks, gotchas
  - Ports section (8123, 8085)
  - Additional tags: publishing, search

### Pre-Commit Fixes (2026-01-13 02:34)
1. **C019 registry endpoints corrected**: Changed `/health` → `/healthz`, `/query` → `/ask` (POST) to match C019's actual API contract
2. **README path corrections**: Fixed all references from `workspace/PROJECT_RELATIONSHIPS.md` to `70_evidence/workspace/PROJECT_RELATIONSHIPS.md` (8 occurrences)
3. **Directory tree updated**: Changed misleading `workspace/` top-level entry to correct `70_evidence/workspace/` structure
