# Constitution Sweep Receipt

**Date**: 2026-01-12
**Operation**: Documentation drift elimination and contract alignment
**Operator**: Claude Code (Opus 4.5)

## Summary

Performed a comprehensive sweep to eliminate doc drift and align tooling contracts with established truth:

1. **Repo Identity** - Removed "C000_info-center" as an identity (keeping only as descriptive "info center" language)
2. **Validator Exit Codes** - Aligned all docs to 0/1/2 contract (removed stale exit code 99 references)
3. **Python Version** - Fixed to 3.11+ (was incorrectly showing 3.13+ in CLAUDE.md)
4. **Run Location** - Fixed validator invocation to "from repo root" pattern
5. **Registry Truth** - Documented registry/repos.yaml as source of truth

## Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `META.yaml` | Added `repo_id: C010_standards` and `owner: Jeremy Bradford` |
| `README.md` | Title → C010_standards, removed C000 aliasing, fixed exit codes (added 2), registry truth note |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Python 3.13+ → 3.11+, removed exit code 99 from troubleshooting |
| `10_docs/glossary.yaml` | Removed "C000_info-center" from aliases |
| `AGENT_START_HERE.md` | Location footer → C010_standards |
| `docs/standards/QUICKSTART.md` | Run location: from repo root |
| `docs/standards/OPERATIONS.md` | Run location: from repo root |
| `10_docs/notes/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` | Removed exit code 99 section, added 0/1/2 reference |
| `PROJECT_PRIMER.md` | Regenerated (no more C000 references) |

## Decisions Made

### Repo Identity
- **Decision**: C010_standards is the canonical identity
- **Rationale**: "C000_info-center" was an alias that caused confusion
- **Kept**: "info center" / "visitor center" as descriptive language only

### Validator Exit Codes
- **Decision**: 0/1/2 only (no 99)
- **Rationale**: Code confirms 99 was removed in Phase 2; docs were stale
- **Contract**:
  - 0 = pass
  - 1 = validation failures
  - 2 = config/parse/runtime setup errors

### Python Version
- **Decision**: 3.11+ minimum
- **Rationale**: pyproject.toml specifies `target-version = "py311"`; validators use type hints available in 3.11+

### Run Location
- **Decision**: Always invoke from repo root: `python validators/run_all.py`
- **Rationale**: Validators add repo root to sys.path; running from validators/ caused import errors

### Files Not Modified
- `70_evidence/workspace/*` - Historical/derived outputs; will update on next generation
- `registry/repos.yaml` - Already correct

## Verification

### Validators Passed
```
$ python validators/run_all.py
▶ Running houston_docmeta (check_houston_docmeta)
✅ DocMeta validation passed (0 docs)
✔ houston_docmeta passed
▶ Running houston_features (check_houston_features)
✅ Houston features validation passed
✔ houston_features passed
▶ Running houston_tools (check_houston_tools)
✅ Houston tools validation passed
✔ houston_tools passed
▶ Running houston_models (check_houston_models)
✅ Houston models validation passed
✔ houston_models passed
▶ Running houston_telemetry (check_houston_telemetry)
✅ Houston telemetry validation passed (no telemetry to validate)
✔ houston_telemetry passed
▶ Running repo_contract (check_repo_contract)
[OK] Repo contract validation passed
✔ repo_contract passed
```

### C000 Search Results
```
$ grep -r "C000_info-center" --include="*.md" --include="*.yaml" | grep -v "70_evidence/"
(no results - only historical files remain)
```

### Primer Regenerated
```
$ generate-project-primer C010_standards
Project: C010_standards
Hash: sha256:f1eb199b83f7
Generated: 2026-01-12T23:38:32
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Owner field in primer** - Shows "unknown" despite META.yaml having owner. May need primer generator update to read this field correctly.

2. **70_evidence/ files** - Still contain historical C000 references. These are derived outputs that will be updated on next workspace-level generation.

## Acceptance Criteria Status

- [x] No "C000_info-center" as repo identity (only descriptive "info center" allowed)
- [x] All docs agree on validator exit codes 0/1/2
- [x] All docs agree on canonical run location (from repo root)
- [x] Python minimum version is 3.11+ consistently
- [x] Registry source-of-truth documented explicitly
- [x] PROJECT_PRIMER.md regenerated with correct info
- [x] Receipt created documenting changes
