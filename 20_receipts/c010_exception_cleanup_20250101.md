# C010 Exception Cleanup Receipt
## Date: 2025-01-01

## Objective
Trim C010's audit_exceptions.yaml to minimal set per "scalpel, not blanket" principle.

## Before State
- 10 exception dirs declared: schemas, taxonomies, protocols, validators, tests, registry, tools, scripts, prompts, workspace
- `compliant: false`, `recommended_action: exception`

## Actions Taken

### 1. Deleted empty directory
- `prompts/` - was completely empty (no files)

### 2. Migrated tools/ to 40_src/
- `tools/export_standards_pulse.py` → `40_src/tools/`
- `tools/glossary_mesh/*` → `40_src/tools/glossary_mesh/`

### 3. Migrated workspace/ to 70_evidence/
- Project briefs (C009_BRIEF.md, KNOWN_PROJECTS.md, etc.)
- PR execution scripts and docs
- Dashboard and registry generation scripts

### 4. Updated audit_exceptions.yaml
- Reduced from 10 → 7 exceptions
- Removed: prompts, tools, workspace
- Kept: schemas, taxonomies, protocols, validators, tests, registry, scripts
- Updated last_reviewed date to 2025-01-01

## After State (Minimal Exception Set)

| Exception | Justification |
|-----------|---------------|
| schemas | Core deliverable - YAML/JSON schema definitions |
| taxonomies | Core deliverable - controlled vocabularies |
| protocols | Core deliverable - Betty Protocol docs, META.yaml spec |
| validators | Python package with internal imports |
| tests | Pytest suite, requires sibling position to validators/ |
| registry | Config consumed by C017_brain-on-tap |
| scripts | Operational scripts incl. audit_folder_structure.sh |

## Verification
- Re-run audit to confirm reduced exception count
- Verify tools and workspace content accessible at new locations
