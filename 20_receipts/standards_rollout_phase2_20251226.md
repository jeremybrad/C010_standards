## Tasks Completed

### 1. Unblocked 4 Pre-commit Hooks

- C009_mcp-memory-http
- C019_docs-site
- W166_fiber-vs-home_reconciliation

### 2. Fixed C009 detect-secrets Failure
**Root cause:** Invalid baseline file (v1.0.0 incompatible with detect-secrets v1.5.0)
**Fix:** Regenerated `.secrets.baseline` with correct version
- 2 known false positives documented (example "mcp-secret" in docs)
