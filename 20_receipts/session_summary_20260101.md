# Session Summary: 2026-01-01
## C010 Standards Audit & Workspace Remediation

### Session Objective
Continue folder structure remediation across workspace, fix audit tooling bugs, and bring repos to compliance.

---

## Completed Work

### 1. C010_standards Exception Cleanup
**Commit:** `0931c8f`

Trimmed exception list from 10 → 7 dirs following "scalpel, not blanket" principle:
- Deleted empty `prompts/` directory
- Migrated `tools/` → `40_src/tools/`
- Migrated `workspace/` → `70_evidence/workspace/`
- Updated `audit_exceptions.yaml` with minimal justified set

**Final exception set:** schemas, taxonomies, protocols, validators, tests, registry, scripts

### 2. C008_CBFS Remediation (Batch 3)
**Commit:** `1d3d194`

- Inspected `verification/` → found empty (0 files)
- Deleted empty directory
- Removed from exception file
- C008 now fully compliant

### 3. P110_knowledge-synthesis-tool Fix
**Commit:** `6499557`

- Added missing `context-templates` and `data` to exception file
- Both were flagged but never declared
- P110 now compliant

### 4. Audit Script Bug Fix
**Commit:** `0179e4f`

- **Bug:** `grep -A 20` truncated exception lists with >20 entries
- **Impact:** P190's last 2 entries (TAGGING_PROMPTS, training_data) were silently ignored
- **Fix:** Increased to `grep -A 100`
- P190 now compliant

### 5. C019_docs-site Cleanup
- Deleted local `venv/` directory (untracked, already in .gitignore)
- C019 now compliant

## Key Discoveries

1. **Audit script had silent truncation bug** - repos with >20 exception entries had trailing entries ignored
2. **Empty directories cause violations** - `verification/` in C008, `venv/` in C019 were empty but flagged
3. **Exception file gaps** - P110 had dirs that existed but were never declared

---

## Files Modified

### C010_standards
- `scripts/audit_folder_structure.sh` - grep limit fix
- `00_admin/audit_exceptions.yaml` - trimmed to 7 exceptions
- `40_src/tools/` - migrated from `tools/`
- `70_evidence/workspace/` - migrated from `workspace/`

### Other Repos
- `C008_CBFS/00_admin/audit_exceptions.yaml` - removed verification entry
- `P110_knowledge-synthesis-tool/00_admin/audit_exceptions.yaml` - added context-templates, data
