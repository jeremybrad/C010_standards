## What Changed This Session

1. **Glossary Mesh v1 Finalization** — Fixed extraction_report.md typo (4→3 repos not found)
2. **Committed glossaries to 17 repos** — C001-C011, C015-C020 with schema glossary.v1
3. **Pushed to remotes** — 15/17 succeeded (C015, C016 have no GitHub remotes)
4. **Merged feature branch to main** — `chore/promote-P002-to-C002` → `main` (fast-forward)
5. **Pushed C010_standards main** — `535d4e5..062c303`

## Commits Made (C010_standards)

| SHA | Message |
|-----|---------|
| `062c303` | docs: Add glossary mesh v1 with universal outputs |

## Files Created/Updated

### Universal Outputs (tools/glossary_mesh/)
- `universal_glossary.yaml` — 168 terms, 17 repos
- `conflicts.md` — 8 aligned, 6 minor, 0 critical
- `extraction_report.md` — methodology + receipts

### Local Glossary
- `docs/glossary.yaml` — 10 terms for C010_standards

## Tests Run

No tests required — documentation/glossary extraction task.

## Uncommitted Changes (Intentionally Left)

| File | Nature | Action |
|------|--------|--------|
| `.DS_Store`, `workspace/.DS_Store` | macOS artifacts | Ignore |
| `.claude/settings.local.json` | Session permissions (+pre-commit bypass) | Local only |
| `workspace/scripts/generate_project_registry.py` | Path fix (SharedData→_SharedData) + mode | Should commit separately |
| 6 `.sh`/`.sh.bak` files | Line-ending noise (0 bytes diff) | Restore or normalize |

## Stash

```
stash@{0}: WIP on chore/promote-P002-to-C002: 2624514 track: Add modernization status tracker...
```
This is from a prior session. Can be dropped if no longer needed.

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **C015, C016 have no GitHub remotes** — Glossary commits are local only
2. **Path fix in generate_project_registry.py** — Should be committed in a separate cleanup PR
3. **Line-ending churn** — Consider adding `.gitattributes` with `text=auto` normalization
4. **Old stash** — Review and drop if obsolete
